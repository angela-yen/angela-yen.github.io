This the first ever website I made in Nov 2021. At this time I just started foundations with Enspiral Dev Academy. This blog was created using HTML and CSS.

The blog contains reflections and plans around my learning journey to code and in tech!

I have grown in learning so much since this blog however, it is always nice to look back at where I started and roots of my coding career!
