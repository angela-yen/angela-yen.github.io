                  <p class="words answer">
                    IQ is more to do with analytical thinking skills and technical skills. IQ is more recognised in school setting such as academic achievements and others. EQ on the other hand is more to do with interpersonal relationships.

                  <p class="words answer">
                    Although IQ is important, as human we are social beings and interact with other around us. As a result, we need to know how to manage and recognise both our own emotions and the people around us. This will help us be able to work in communities and in groups. Working in the tech industry, many of the projects that we will be working on are going to be in groups with people. It is also a highly stressful and demanding industry. As a result of this, it is important to be able to know when we are feeling stressed and overwhelmed and have the capacity to deal with these emotions. It will also help us have empathy towards others that we are working with as well.
