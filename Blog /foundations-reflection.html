            <p class="words answer">
                <ol>
                    <li>I don’t mind asking for help and reaching out to people however, this is usually to a peer rather than to a facilitator. </li>
                    <li>Putting a lot of pressure on myself can lead to lack of motivation to start the task. </li>
                    <li>I work better with people rather than self-directed in isolation. </li>

    <div>
        <h3 class="words text-center"><b>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</b></h3>
        <p class="words answer">
            All of these roles help with problem solving and also interacting with other people, working in groups and teams. It can also help with self growth within the learning journey.

        <h3 class="words text-center"><b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b></h3>
            <p class="words answer"> 
                That a lot of the things I knew about myself already were still relevant within coding and despite having awareness of short comings, it is still hard to overcome them. After talking to others as well, I found that many of the feelings I was having was similar within other people in programme as well. 
            </p>
    <div>
        <h3 class="words text-center"><b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b></h3>
            <p class="words answer">  
                Having motivation to do it after a long day/week of technical coding. I found that it was less quantifiable which meant the “progress” is harder to see.

    <div>
        <h3 class="words text-center"><b>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </b></h3>
            <p class="words answer">
                It helps with becoming not only a good programmer but also a good person. It teaches how to get past issues and also work with others. It also helps create a growth environment that accommodates for issues that could come up in a work environment.

        <h3 class="words text-center"><b>•	Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b></h3>
            <p class="words answer">
                It doesn’t feel like a waste of time however, I do know that I put less emphasis on it as I am more worried about not being able to learn how to code. I think they are both equally as important, if anything, becoming a smart learner and problem solving comes with the core teachings. As a result, I do see value in core however, I did find it difficult to have the same level of motivation towards it than compared to learning for example, JavaScript.
