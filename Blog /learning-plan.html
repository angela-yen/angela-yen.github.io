                        I would love to work in a mental health/health related start up as a developer. However, at this stage I am pretty open to discovering what the different avenues of web dev are and where there are different opportunities/areas that require tech developments.

                    <p class="words answer"> 
                        I am a good problem solver and also relatively resilient. This means that I have the ability to learn new skills and adapt them. I also like to keep working at things when I am committed to them until they are at a point where I am happy with it. At times this can be an issue because it means I end up spending too much time on projects. Giving each task a particular time block can help me overcome this issues. 
</p>
<p class="words answer">
I also enjoy working with people and value relationships. As a result of this, collaboration and interacting with people in slack will be an avenue that I turn to for support and help.

                    <p class="words asnwer"> I would like to develop more leaderships skills and understand what these may look like in a tech industry. I have had quite a lot of leaderships training throughout my teaching career however, I would like to continue to see what can be adapted and which areas require further development.

        <h4 class="text-center button">Commitment to Workload Management</h4>
        <h5 class="text-center"> To Others</h5>
        <p class="words answer"> Time management is very important to me and therefore, blocking out time and prioritising particular work. It is also important to be mindful that there will be periods of stress as a result, communication with other learning, facilitators and people that I will be engaging with should be through a respectful and culturally responsive way. This also mean holding myself accountable for the work that I need to do but also acknowledge at times when I may  need extra support. 
</p>
<h5 class="text-center"> To Myself</h5>
<p class="words answer"> When things are starting to get overwhelming and stressful for me, I will first see what I am able to manage and then speak to people about how I am feeling and what sorts of supports I need. Depending on the situation it may be taking some space and time for a breather, at others it may be working with other people collaboratively. It is important for me to be able to notice when I am starting to feel like things are building up. This is why practices such as mindfulness and meditation can help with stress relieving.

    <h4 class="text-center button">Seeking Help</h4>
    <p class="words answer">
        In terms of tech support, my first turn will be to google then, the slack channel will be somewhere that I go to for help and if all means fails, contacting the facilitator. I also have some programming friends who would be able to offer me some support if I get stuck. 
</p>
<p class="words answer">
In terms of mental health support, I will be reaching out to my friends and flatmates during times that I need support. I will also be checking in with my facilitator and letting them know how I am feeling when it starts to feel like I may be overwhelmed. 
</p>
<p class="words answer">
I will be aiming to give myself a few days to figure out what sort of support I need but never to the point where it is more than a couple of days.

    <h4 class="text-center button">Expectation from Facilitators</h4>
    <p class="words answer">
        Being approachable, so far I have found my interactions with the facilitators very approachable which has been very helpful. I think it is important to acknowledge that mental health and wellbeing is an essential part of people and that there is space and room for flexibility when it comes to dealing with general wellbeing issues.

    <h4 class="text-center button">Scheduling</h4>
    <p class="words answer">
        Ideally I would like to complete the work that needs to be done during the week and on time. It has been a slow start for me due to the overlap of uni but I want to be able to catch up as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p class="words answer">
It is also important when it comes to working collaboratively, to find times and understand that other group members may have other responsibilities that we may need to take into consideration. Coming into these situations with empathy and compassion is very important to be able to create safe spaces for effective communication and collaboration to take place.
