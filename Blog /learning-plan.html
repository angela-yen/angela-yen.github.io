                            After dabbling with coding over the past couple of weeks, I am still not too sure where exactly where I am heading. I do know that I have enjoyed it and I still want to be able to work in a place that does work in alignment of my values of helping people, likely in an area such as mental health. I have also realised that I enjoy the problem solving aspects of coding rather than how it looks. This makes me thing that I may be more suited towards backend development. However, I am yet to have a clear direction, which in some ways is very exciting!

                        <p class="words answer"> 
                            Looking at the strengths that I wrote in sprint 2, I noticed that a lot of it is still very relevant however, interacting with people in the cohort, has made me realise that working with others is definitely a strong part of me as a learner and as a person too. I think it is my ability to communicate and also be open to understanding people’s different perspectives in things that make it easier to work with people. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="words answer">
                            I have really developed the ability to google things and then learn to adapt it to the problem at hand. This really surprised me and how I was able to try to understand the code and logical thinking. I think that this is something that will help me during bootcamp and continue to work on.

                        <p class="words answer"> 
                            I have also found that I am still a very curious person that likes to know how things work and what they mean. In some ways this is great for learning and staying motivated and interested however, sometimes it can lead to me feeling frustrated. As I start to understand coding, I realise that there is a lot and theories around it that I would physically not be able to understand all concepts of it within a small timeframe. This is something I need to learn to be ok with, is not knowing how everything works and focusing more on problem solving rather than knowing everything. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="words answer">
                            I think I may struggle with motivation during bootcamp in terms of having to sit with not knowing what to do. I know that during the foundations, there were times where I really didn’t want to look at the code as I felt like I was stuck. I think it is important for me to continue to remind myself of the problem solving methods and also that it is ok to be stuck not let that demotivate me.

                        <p class="words asnwer"> 
                            I think stress will be the most difficult thing I will struggling with. I find that when I am stressed I really struggle to take care of other things in my life such as exercise and food. I want to be able to keep a good routine over the bootcamp period and allow time for myself to focus on me as well as stay focused.

                            I would like to be able to develop a better ability to receive feedback and also not take it personally. I have found in the past I place a lot of my worth on my successes and achievements, this means that sometimes when I receive feedback, it takes a hit on my feelings of self-worth. This is something that I am actively working on however, it is still a work in process. I would like to really take this bootcamp as a space to develop a stronger sense of self that can take feedback and allow of growth. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="words asnwer">   
                            I would also like to develop some more leaderships skills in the sense of being able to delegate tasks withing group projects. I have found in the past this has been an area that I struggle with specifically with delegating and figuring out how to work effectively and equally as group. I imagine there will be a lot of opportunities to work in groups and teams and therefore, lots of chances to try and figure out ways that work for me and also the groups.

                        <p class="words asnwer"> 
                            I am hoping to try all the problem solving techniques I have learned during foundations e.g. rubber ducky, googling, sudo code etc. before reaching out to others. I enjoy coding with other people and talking about it so I will most likely reach out to peers and see if anyone is stuck on the same thing and we can work together. Otherwise I may reach out to facilitators for guidance however, I understand their role is to nudge us in the right direction rather than spoon feeding so I will aim to solve the problems myself.
                        </p>
                        <p class="words asnwer"> 
                            However, it can also be easy to get stuck on a problem for too long and not get anywhere. I think I will set myself a timeframe to figure it out (dependant on the task) and once I have reached that timeframe and can’t figure it out, I will be reach out for help either to peers for facilitators.

                            I am committed to manage my workloads using organising skills such as, timeblocks and scheduling of tasks. This is important for me to stay on track and also acts as goal for myself. When working with others, it is important to keep open communication and also have timeblocks set with the other person. This will help me stay accountable for myself. Ideally I want to be able to enjoy some of my personal time, so as much as I can, I would like to sperate home and work space. If I need to spend more time on working, I will aim to do it at EDA, rather than take my work home. I think it is important to continue to maintain my exercise and eating schedule, which is something I really struggle to do under pressure, as a result I will spend the 1st week of bootcamp figuring out what would work, and then make adjustments throughout the time.

                        <p class="words asnwer"> 
                            I know that I have a tendency to overwork myself, so I think it is important for me to reflect on my own wellbeing and my stress levels frequently. This will help me monitor how I am going an be able to reach out of help or other assistance if I need. This will be important for me to ensure that I do not burn out.

                        I would love to work in a mental health/health related start up as a developer. However, at this stage I am pretty open to discovering what the different avenues of web dev are and where there are different opportunities/areas that require tech developments.

                        I am a good problem solver and also relatively resilient. This means that I have the ability to learn new skills and adapt them. I also like to keep working at things when I am committed to them until they are at a point where I am happy with it. At times this can be an issue because it means I end up spending too much time on projects. Giving each task a particular time block can help me overcome this issues.

                    <p class="words answer">
                        I also enjoy working with people and value relationships. As a result of this, collaboration and interacting with people in slack will be an avenue that I turn to for support and help.

                        I would like to develop more leaderships skills and understand what these may look like in a tech industry.

                <p class="words answer"> 
                    Time management is very important to me and therefore, blocking out time and prioritising particular work. It is also important to be mindful that there will be periods of stress as a result, communication with other learning, facilitators and people that I will be engaging with should be through a respectful and culturally responsive way. This also mean holding myself accountable for the work that I need to do but also acknowledge at times when I may  need extra support. 
                </p>
                <h5 class="text-center"> To Myself</h5>
                <p class="words answer"> 
                    When things are starting to get overwhelming and stressful for me, I will first see what I am able to manage and then speak to people about how I am feeling and what sorts of supports I need. Depending on the situation it may be taking some space and time for a breather, at others it may be working with other people collaboratively. It is important for me to be able to notice when I am starting to feel like things are building up. This is why practices such as mindfulness and meditation can help with stress relieving.

                    In terms of tech support, my first turn will be to google then, the slack channel will be somewhere that I go to for help and if all means fails, contacting the facilitator. I also have some programming friends who would be able to offer me some support if I get stuck.

                <p class="words answer">
                    In terms of mental health support, I will be reaching out to my friends and flatmates during times that I need support. I will also be checking in with my facilitator and letting them know how I am feeling when it starts to feel like I may be overwhelmed.

                <p class="words answer">
                    I will be aiming to give myself a few days to figure out what sort of support I need but never to the point where it is more than a couple of days.

                    Being approachable, so far I have found my interactions with the facilitators very approachable which has been very helpful. I think it is important to acknowledge that mental health and wellbeing is an essential part of people and that there is space and room for flexibility when it comes to dealing with general wellbeing issues.

            </p>
            <p class="words answer">
                It is also important when it comes to working collaboratively, to find times and understand that other group members may have other responsibilities that we may need to take into consideration. Coming into these situations with empathy and compassion is very important to be able to create safe spaces for effective communication and collaboration to take place.
