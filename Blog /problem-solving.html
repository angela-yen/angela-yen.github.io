                    <p class="words answer">
                        There are many different types of problem solving methods including the ones listed below:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pseudocode</li>
                            <li>Trying Something</li>
                            <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
                            <li>Reading error messages</li>
                            <li>Console.logging</li>
                            <li>Googling</li>
                            <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
                            <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                            <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety).</li>
                            <li>Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that’s all right.</li>
                            <li>Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code line by line.</li>
                            <li>At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing. The duck will sit there serenely, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you on your way.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="words answer">
                            Putting the effort to teach my rubber duck helped me recognise whether I actually understood a topic. For example, there were topics in the study guide that I had glanced over, thinking that I had already grasped them. When I tried teaching those topics, I realised I did not have a complete understanding and I needed to go back and study them.

                        <p class="words answer">
                            Reading an essay out loud that I wanted to edit helped me to decide whether sentences were grammatically correct and whether the essay flowed well.

                        <p class="words answer">
                            Sometimes, teaching a rubber duck was more useful than explaining the problem to a colleague, because suggestions from a colleague may lead to distractions or digressions, making it harder to solve the problem.

                        I was doing the super FizzBuzz, it felt like a very overwhelming task as there was quite a lot to it. I ws sort of stuck and didn't know what to do. But then I used the rubber ducky method and talked to my flatmate about what I was doing and realise that I was so close, I just had to change the order of the loops for it to work. Throughout the process I felt like I was getting closer and surprisingly enough I didn’t actually feel too stressed out about it. It was quite frustrating but I knew that I would be able to get there. I also find that googling has been very useful for me as often I can find a “solution” that is very similar to our questions but then I have to unpack it to understand what it is telling me. Through this I am able to decipher through and it actually ends up being quite useful.

                        Overall I felt quite confident about the situation but when I started to explain it to my friend’s who didn’t necessarily know what I was talking about, it all started to make sense. I do feel that I was able to strengthen my problem solving skills through this particular exercise.

                        I found the entire gradebook exercise quite interesting and overwhelming at first. I got stuck on trying to understand the concept of assigning an array to a person’s name within an object. Now that I am reflecting and writing it out, it seems pretty obvious but at the time I couldn’t wrap my head around it. It took a lot of googling but I found that when I stepped away and came back to it, it started to work. The way I wanted it to as well, which made me really happy, I realised that I was looking at it for too long so I got stuck in it. I found that at the beginning of the question when I wrote out the pseudocode, I didn’t really know what I was writing, but I found going through and adjusting each of the sentences as I was working through the problem also really helped with the process.

                    I felt very proud of being able to resolve this problem without seeking too much external help, it really showed me that I was starting to understand the logic behind JavaScript a bit more. I found the tests were a way to sort of do coding in reverse order and it helped me go through step by step what each part of the question was asking me.
