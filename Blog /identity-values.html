    <h2 class="words"><em>1. My Core Values</em></h2>
    <p class="words answer">
        I would say that my core personal values comes down to helping other and having a deep sense of empathy. I find what give me passion and drive is working towards helping others and supporting others. This is one of the reasons I have always been drawn towards humanitarian work including teaching and psychology. It is also one that I hold strongly and even within the possible future of working in tech, I aim towards being able to help others within this field. 
        I believe in being compassionate and open minded towards others. This means having the ability to see things from other people’s perspectives and understanding that people’s beliefs and opinions comes from their own experiences and values. Listening is such an important part of being a human, more than talking.

        <h3 class="words text-center"><b>Ethical Decision</b></h3>
        <p class="words answer">
            When I was teaching, there were many times where the students had “broken” school rules. In some cases it was just a small uniform problem, in others it was more severe issues. An example would be the students walking into the classroom smelling of cigarette smoke. In the beginning of my teaching journey I was very alarmed by this situation and would always report them to the deans. However, as I started to see the repercussions of the this, I found that there were not supportive structures in place for students. Rather, reporting the students to senior management would mean they would miss out on their learning and be punished by a system that was not created to serve many of them. 
</p>
<p class="words answer">
            As a result of this, I have found instances where I ended up speaking to the students about what was going on for them and the reasons around their decision to smoke. To me, it was more important that I had a good relationship with them and they felt safe in my classroom to get support and then refer them to the health centre than for them to be stood down and punished. 
        </p>
        <p class="words answer">   
            The consequence of this decision was that other teachers with the same students would often come to me and ask why I didn’t tell the dean and the fact is, I did not see them smoking in my class and therefore, do not have solid evidence to suggest that they themselves were the ones smoking. At the end of the day, I was able to develop a trusting relationship with the students and for many of them, they were more open for me to have a conversation about the risk to their health than if they were punished for it.

            <h3 class="words text-center"><b>Cultural Value</b></h3>
        <p class="words answer"> Growing up in Aotearoa and being a first generation immigrant, it has always been an interesting journey thinking about my culture and how it impacts my value and identity. I am at a point now where I have recognise that my Taiwanese heritage is deeply rooted in my up bringing however, many of which my values are also influenced by Western culture. Inherently the idea of looking out for communities and seeing people beyond their individual self; comes from the notion of collectivism. So as I now navigate my way, I understand that all my experiences inform my positionality and the relationships around me inform the values I have.

    <h2 class="words"><em>2. Strengths and Limitations</em></h2>
    <h3 class="words text-center"><b>Strengths</b></h3>
    <p class="words answer">  
        I have always been a people’s person, so a large part of that includes the ability to work with people through a caring and compassionate manner and forming relationships. 
    </p>
    <p class="words answer">
    I am also someone who is very curious and creative and with that comes with wanting to learn lots of new skills and hear other people perspectives. This will becomes useful when it comes to problem solving and finding creative solutions. 
    </p>
<p class="words answer">
I am someone who takes pride in my work and I believe that my careful considerations in the work that I do will lead me to make project that I am proud of and ones that will be in alignment with what I am planning on doing in the future.

<div>
    <h3 class="words text-center"><b>Limitations</b></h3>
    <p class="words answer">
        Unrelenting standards has always been a significant issue for me and as a result of the inability to live up to these standards, I sometimes find myself being immobilised. This means that I would have a voice in my head telling me that I am a failure so I might as well give up. This is something that I have always struggling with however, I have become more aware of the signs as I got down this path of thinking. 
</p>
<p class="words answer">
I have found that taking a break and talking to other about how I have been feeling has always helped and acknowledging that it is ok to not know what to do. That is part of the journey of learning.

    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="words text-center"><b>Strengths to Overcome Challenges</b></h3>
    <p class="words answer">
        I am always willing to ask for help. I see a lot of value in finding solutions and also asking people when I am feeling stuck. As a result of this, this will be able to help me to work collaboratively with other. As a I mentioned above one of the most important things to me is working with people through being compassionate and open. Through these values I have often formed very valuable relationships with others that have been reciprocal. This also means that at times when I feel stuck I will be able to reach out for help before I become immobilised and stressed out.

    <h3 class="words text-center"><b>Group Work</b></h3>
    <p class="words answer">
        In the semester just passed, I had to work with my group to create a shared group report and presentations. It was a massive assignment and although we have an amazing group of people, it was very difficult to delegate tasks. One of the issues we came across was deadline. We had allocated tasks to each person however, for some of the tasks, they could only be done when the previous task was completed.
</p>
<p class="words answer">
        Communication was very important for us, we found that setting a deadline for each section of the task was more effective. This way each person can pass onto the next person effectively. We were also aware as a team that there may have been other deadlines or assignments that we had to do on the side, therefore, we create a safe space for people to reach out when they felt like they were struggling. 
        </p>
        <p class="words answer">
        At the start of the project we also asked each person what skills they had and what types of tasks they enjoyed doing. The entire project had different sections including PowerPoints, writing and video recording. We were able to delegate tasks based on each group members’ preferences and they unique skills sets. At the end of the project we found that this was very effective as it meant that collaboratively we were able to create a high standard project as our unique skillsets were able to give a well-rounded outcome. 
        </p>
        <p class="words answer">
        This was a massive learning experience and I found definitely would continue to use these skills again in the future projects. Other strategies I might try is using different platforms to work on, we were using google docs and slides, which were useful but I feel like there may be other platforms around that may be useful in the future.
