                        Neuroplasticity is the idea that the brain has the ability to change and depending on what information we feed it and the repetition of the certain information, it will strengthen it in our head. It is beneficial as it means that everyone has the ability to learn and become “smart” and improve skills and knowledge.

                        Principles around neuroplasticity means that I was use it to change my mindset into growth mindset and see the potential for learning when I feel stuck on a problem or situation. Every experience or difficult scenario is an opportunity for growth and development.

                        Growth mindset is in line with the idea of neuroplasticity where, if we believe that our mind has the ability to learn. This is relevant as it means that when it comes to learning new things, especially things that are difficult and hard, it means that we are able to get through them. If we take a growth mindset perspective, it means that we see each difficult situation as a learning experience rather than feeling like we are not good enough or smart enough. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="words answer">
                        Growth mindset has been something that I have been trying to work on for a quite a while and something that is hard to do. I find that a lot of the times where I fall into the fixed mindset trap, it is when I am feeling insecure and doubting myself. In these cases, I find that I take things more personal rather than seeing them as an opportunity for growth. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="words answer">
                        I want to read the growth mindset book at some point to continue to remind myself that a lot of the ways we deal with in life, is the perspective we have. I will try to remind myself that every time I get to a difficult question, I should take a step back and remind myself that it is not a reflection of my “smartness” rather, it is an opportunity for growth.

                        I think both concepts of neuroplasticity and growth mindset are important to integrate into my learning plan. Through incorporating focus and attention to my body and mind as well as learning the technical skills. I can imagine that throughout bootcamp, there will be times where I will feel stuck like I don’t know what to do, during these times, it is important to remember that everything is a learning process and I am on a path to learning how to code and also to problem solve. It is not just about understanding how to do all the coding, it is also how to face problems; emotionally and technically. It also highlights the importance of having people around us that are supportive and also being that supportive person to others.
